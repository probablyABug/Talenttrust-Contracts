# Escrow Performance and Gas Baselines

This document defines regression guardrails for the escrow contract's key flows.

## Scope

Baselines are enforced by tests in `contracts/escrow/src/test/performance.rs` for:

- `create_contract`
- `deposit_funds`
- `release_milestone`
- `refund`
- `cancel`
- `dispute`
- end-to-end sequence (`create_contract` -> `deposit_funds` -> `release_milestone`)

## Methodology

1. Use Soroban test environment invocation metering via `env.cost_estimate()`.
2. Capture invocation resources and fee estimate after each top-level call.
3. Assert each metric is below stable upper limits to detect regressions.

Note: Soroban resource estimates in unit tests are approximations and can differ from on-chain simulation. Baselines are conservative ceilings intended for CI regression detection.
